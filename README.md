Okay sorry, I had to do this :) [Here is the actual link] (https://github.com/hasancatalgol/level_based_persona). 

## What is Streamlit?
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is an open source app framework in [Python](https://www.python.org/) language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
In this repo, I made a Streamlit App from my previous work.

## Project Steps

- Installed libraries in an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment which created just for this project 
- Used Streamlit elements for frontend 
- Took a lot of smoking breaks
