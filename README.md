# Level Based Persona Streamlit App
## What is Streamlit?
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is an open source app framework in [Python](https://www.python.org/) language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
In this repo, I made a Streamlit App for my previous work [Level Based Persona](https://github.com/hasancatalgol/level_based_persona).
