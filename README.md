## What is Streamlit?
-------
###[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is an open source app framework in [Python](https://www.python.org/) language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
###In this repo, I made a Streamlit App from my previous work.
